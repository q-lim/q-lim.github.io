                <p>Large amounts of chitin in seafood waste are discarded as low-value products annually.
                    Harnessing chitin from seafood waste is beneficial for producing sustainable novel eco-friendly biodegradable plastic alternatives using natural materials from non-flora sources.
                    Developing materials made from both natural and synthetic polymers is paramount to the process of producing sustainable plastics from natural sources.
                    Hence, nanochitin was synthesized by acid hydrolysis and TEMPO-mediated oxidation to produce nanocomposite films with polyvinyl alcohol.
                    The films were used to investigate the effect of adding ionic salts as an ionic shielding agent on their mechanical, thermal, and optical properties.
                    Ionic shielding was shown to increase with cationic charge of ionic salts, leading to improved thermal and mechanical properties of the films by 22-50%.
                    There was no clear trend of optical properties improvement with increases in ionic shielding.
                    However, the ionic shielding effect still shows immense potential for producing plastics with tuneable properties.
                    Further investigation into the behaviour of ionic shielding within different polymeric systems is the next step towards developing sustainable plastics of the future.</p>

                  <p>Sustainable development is pivotal to the development of infrastructure as Singapore continues to develop as a first-world country.
                    Utilization of floating platforms on water is an effective method of creating space for new infrastructure without destruction of flora and fauna.
                    In line with sustainable development, recycling of commonly disposed items serves to reduce Singaporeâ€™s waste production and accelerate her development as a first-world country.
                    This work proposes a novel, bilayer modular floating platform designed for use in freshwater bodies.
                    Since upcycling has emerged as a creative method for waste management, this design is constructed from commonly disposed household items and will give them a second life.
                    Moreover, dividing the load bearing and buoyant components into separate layers would decrease the breaking and warping, as well as allowing easy maintenance of faulty areas without deconstructing the floating platforms.</p>

                Evaluation of silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite microspheres for potential bone regeneration applications

                <p>Bone fractures are the 4<sup>th</sup> most prevalent cause of morbidity, and the risk of sustaining bone fractures is increased by diseased bone.
                    Osteoblasts are cells which are responsible for the formation of bone tissue and can be produced by the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
                    Mesenchymal stem cells are essential to the fracture healing process as they proliferate in the haematoma before the formation of the soft callus and subsequently bridging bone before the bone is remodeled to its original shape.
                    Hydroxyapatite is a bioceramic with the closest chemical similarity to natural bone and is currently used in scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.
                    Silicon is an element involved in the early stages of bone calcification and has a structural and metabolic role in hard connective tissue in vivo.
                    This study involves the substitution of silicon in the form of orthosilicic acid into hydroxyapatite to determine whether silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite is a more favourable material than hydroxyapatite for bone regeneration applications.
                    Hydroxyapatite and silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite microspheres were produced, seeded with mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and the density of mesenchymal stem cells was compared over a 9-day period.
                    Silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite microspheres showed a greater density of mesenchymal stem cells than the hydroxyapatite microspheres over this 9-day period.
                    This shows more osteoblasts can be produced in vivo in the presence of silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite microsphere scaffolds, potentially shortening the fracture healing time and making silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite a more favourable material for bone regeneration applications.</p>

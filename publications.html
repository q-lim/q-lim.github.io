                  Presently, the rapid depletion of resources and drastic climate change highlight the importance of sustainable development.
                  In this case, nanochitin derived from chitin, the second most abundant renewable polymer in the world, possesses numerous advantages, including toughness, easy processability and biodegradability.
                  Furthermore, it exhibits better dispersibility in various solvents and higher reactivity than chitin owing to its increased surface area to volume ratio. Additionally, it is the only natural polysaccharide that contains nitrogen.
                  Therefore, it is valuable to further develop this innovative technology. This review summarizes the recent developments in nanochitin and specifically identifies sustainable strategies for its preparation.
                  Additionally, the different biomass sources that can be exploited for the extraction of nanochitin are highlighted.
                  More importantly, the life cycle assessment of nanochitin preparation is discussed, followed by its applications in advanced manufacturing and perspectives on the valorization of chitin waste.

                  Characterization and in‐vitro assessment of silicon‐based apatite microspheres for bone tissue engineering applications

                  In the field of bone tissue engineering, silicon (Si) has been found as an essential element for bone growth.
                  However, the use of silicon in bioceramics microspheres remains limited.
                  In this work, different weight percentages (0.8, 1.6, and 2.4 wt %) of silicon was incorporated into hydroxyapatite and fabricated into microspheres.
                  2.4 wt % of Si incorporated into HAp microspheres (2.4 SiHAp) were found to enhance functional properties of the microspheres which resulted in improved cell viability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs),
                  demonstrating rapid cell proliferation rates resulting in high cell density accumulated on the surface of the microspheres which in turn permitted better hMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts when validated by bone marker assays
                  (Type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteopontin) compared to apatite microspheres of lower wt % of Si incorporated and non-substituted HAp (2.4 SiHAp >1.6 SiHAp >0.8 SiHAp > HAp).
                  SEM images displayed the densest cell population on 2.4 SiHAp surfaces with the greatest degree of cell stretching and bridging between neighboring microspheres.
                  Incorporation of silicon into apatite microspheres was found to accelerate the rate and number of apatite nucleation sites formed when subjected to physiological conditions improving the interface between the microsphere scaffolds
                  and bone forming cells, facilitating better adhesion and proliferation.

                  Hydroxyapatite is a naturally occurring calcium phosphate widely used in biomedical applications because of its osteoconductivity, biocompatibility and it possesses the closest chemical similarity to natural bone.
                  Hydroxyapatite is also a versatile material and can be used in a plethora of ways beyond biomedical applications.
                  This review summarises the applications of hydroxyapatite in biomedical, bioimaging, separation, purification, catalysis, surface treatment and energy storage applications.
                  Finally, this review aims to shed light on its potential for new applications of hydroxyapatite in the future.

                  Optimizing fabrication parameters via Taguchi method for production of high yield hydroxyapatite microsphere scaffolds using Drop‐on‐Demand inkjet method

                  Drop on demand (DOD) inkjet method is a cost-efficient way of producing hydroxyapatite (HAp) microsphere scaffolds with narrow size distribution.
                  However, DOD fabrication parameters may influence the yield and characteristics of the microsphere scaffolds.
                  Testing different permutations and combinations of fabrication parameters is costly and time consuming.
                  Taguchi method could be used as a predictive tool for optimizing the key fabrication parameters to produce HAp microspheres with desired yield and properties, minimizing the number of experimental combinations to be tested.
                  The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the fabrication parameters on the characteristics of the microspheres formed and determine optimum parameter conditions for producing high yield HAp microsphere scaffolds with the desired properties intended to serve as potential bone substitutes.
                  We aimed to achieve microspheres with high production yield, microsphere size of &lt;230 μm, micropore sizes &lt;1 μm, rough surface morphology and high sphericity.
                  Experiments were conducted using Taguchi method with a L9 orthogonal array at three levels per parameter to determine optimum parameter values for (1) operating pressure, (2) shutter speed duration, (3) nozzle height and (4) CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration.
                  Based on signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio analysis, the identified optimum parameter conditions for operating pressure, shutter speed duration, nozzle height and CaCl2 concentration to be 0.9–1.3 bar, 100 ms, 8 cm and 0.4 M respectively.
                  The microspheres obtained had an average size of 213 μm, 0.45 μm micropore size, high sphericity index of 0.95 and high production yield of 98%. Confirmation tests and ANOVA results affirms the validity of Taguchi method in optimizing HAp microspheres with high yield, desired size, micropore size and shape.
                  HAp microsphere scaffolds produced by optimum conditions were subjected to a 7-day in-vitro study.
                  Cells remained viable and continued to proliferate (increased 1.2-fold) over 7 days with microspheres maintaining high cell density with cells bridging between microspheres.
                  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay increased 1.5-fold from day 1, suggesting good osteogenic potency of HAp microspheres as potential bone substitutes.

                  Hydroxyapatite (HAp) has been widely researched on due to its chemical similarity to native bone.
                  HAp microspheres can encourage good cellular attachment due to their high surface area to volume ratio, facilitating further proliferation and differentiation of cells at later stages.
                  To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of HAp microspheres in physiological conditions, we investigated their behaviour and key characteristic changes in both static and dynamic conditions.
                  We found both environments exhibiting similar results but noticeably the microspheres in the dynamic environment resulted in faster rate of degradation. The degradation mechanism follows that of a surface degradation process.
                  Microspheres underwent reduction in size and weight loss upon release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline medium (DPBS).
                  Apatite reprecipitation was visible in the form of granular deposits in both environments from day 1 and continued throughout 21 days which altered the size of the microspheres but not its shape.
